  	<h1>Michael Jackson - Stranger in Moscow.</h1>
  	<p>I was wandering in the rain
		Mask of life, feelin' insane
		Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be
	How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold insideLike a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm livin' lonely
I'm livin' lonely baby
A stranger in Moscow
I'm livin' lonely
I'm livin' lonely baby
A stranger in Moscow </p>
